Data Mining is a method that is used to extract information from a complex database. As in healthcare sectors huge amount of data is stored and all that is transformed into a useful insight and data mining methods used to detect any disease with an adequate precision. In this research, data cleaning and pre-processing technique is being used to make the data more effective and efficient to carry out an analysis to recognize the risk of thyroid to an individual and several data mining technique are being used to identify thyroid disease. As machine learning will play a significant role for predicting disease. A thyroid dataset is collected from UCI ML repository. Support vector machines and Random Forest models are used to identify thyroid disease and symptoms of thyroid disease in four classes namely negative, hyperthyroid, hypothyroid, and sick.
